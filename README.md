# Free LaPrensa

A nefarious browser extension that easily bypasses the LaPrensa paywall.

If things aren't working as expected, make sure to reinstall (update) the extension from time to time, to make sure you have the latest code.

## Install

Installation has to be done manually. I'm not interested in distributing this extension in the Mozilla / Google addon 'stores'.


### Chrome 

 1. Download the [extension ZIP file](https://github.com/lkgwu/free-Newsss/archive/master.zip)

 2. Unzip the file.

 3. In Google Chrome (or Chromium), in the address bar go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)

 4. In the top right corner, click to enable **Developer Mode**.

 5. Click the **Load unpacked extension** button.

 6. Navigate to the folder you unziped your code to, and select it.

 7. The **FreePrensa** extension should now be loaded.

## Troubleshooting
